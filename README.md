This is learning material that explains the functionality of the Naive Bayes Classifier.

## 1. Introduction
Naive Bayes can be a powerful algorithm, especially when a few assumptions are met by our data. Unfortunately, most sources explain the algorithm by jumping into these assumptions, without laying the ground work for what motivates using Bayes Theorem and how it translates into Machine Learning contexts. This summary aims to provide exactly that intuition.

## 2. Concepts explained
- Bayes Theorem
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
